  "whatIsDescription": "Roman numerals are a numeral system originating in ancient Rome, using letters from the Latin alphabet to represent numbers. The basic symbols are I (1), V (5), X (10), L (50), C (100), D (500), and M (1000). Numbers are formed by combining these symbols according to specific rules: symbols are typically added together (VI = 6), but when a smaller numeral appears before a larger one, it is subtracted (IV = 4). This system was widely used throughout the Roman Empire and medieval Europe, and continues to be used today for decorative purposes, clock faces, movie copyright dates, and numbered lists."
